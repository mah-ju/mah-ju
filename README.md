# Hi there! I'm Maria Júlia 👋

Motivated by a passion for learning, I have already explored diverse areas, and now I am challenging myself to learn programming. Currently working in social media analytics and monitoring, I hold a degree in environmental management and a master's degree in the same field. Fun fact: My academic journey started in graphic design college, making my path a bit of a delightful maze!
